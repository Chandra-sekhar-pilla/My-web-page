# My web page
 A simple example of the web page 
 
 Used vanilla js to create the open and close effect of the account bar
 Added many things like account sidebar, mode switching (dark mode to light mode and vice versa)
 Added more functionality and some quick buttons too.
 
 Hope you will learn something and thankyou.
